### `Our Mission`

Build a version of Hacker News with a search feature by using their API: https://hn.algolia.com/api

### `How do we do that?`

To display all the articles about a specific topic, let’s say “React”, You’ll have to target the Search endpoint of the API:
http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=...

### `Step 1`

  **Load news directly from the HN API about a pre-set topic (e.g: React)**
  **When this is done and working, create a search bar, and allow the user to search for any topic (search input + “Search” button)**

### `Step 2`
  **Display a spinner or a loading message when the news are being fetched**
  **Handle the scenario where no news match the user search**
  **Handle potential errors from the API and alert the user**
 
 ### `Step 3`
  **Implement pagination**

**Note: updating**
